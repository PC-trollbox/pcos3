# How to change my password
(knowing my current password)
**The CLI Route**

1. Log into the OS.
2. Open "Terminal".
3. Type in `su <username>`. Replace `<username>` with your actual username.
4. Log into the terminal.
5. Type in `passwd`. **As a result of executing `passwd` successfully, any other authentication factors are lost!**
6. Enter the new password slowly and carefully, making sure no character is lost due to latency.
7. Confirm the password, also making sure no character is lost.
