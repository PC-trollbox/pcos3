# How to create the System ID

1. Start or restart the system.
2. Immediately start pressing Enter multiple times until the Preference Manager appears. (If asked, enter the superpassword.)
3. Select "System ID settings".
4. Select "Reset System ID". The previous System ID will be lost.
5. Select "Back", then select "Exit".

To copy System ID to a different system, you can use the "Show private System ID" option on the source system and the "Import System ID" option on the destination system. After copying, you should verify the System ID consistency to make sure you didn't make mistakes. **The private System ID should be private and transferred over a secure connection only!**
