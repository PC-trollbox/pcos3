# How to start using ZKPP

ZKPP (Zero-Knowledge Password Proof) is a way to log in with your password that doesn't send the password to the user account system directly. This scheme is more secure if you are using a managed users configuration.

1. Log into the OS.
2. Open "Personal Security".
3. Click "x" next to the "PBKDF2 (Password)" entry.
4. Click "Add".
5. Select "ZKPP (Password)".
6. Click "*" next to the "ZKPP (Password)" entry.
7. In the Password field, type in your new password. **An unique password is required to ensure the security of the ZKPP scheme used.**
8. Click "Confirm"
9. Click "Save".
