Packets are generated in this way:
Source address (16 bytes) / Target address (16 bytes) / Packet ID (16 bytes) / Protocol (1 byte) / Payload
The packet size is currently unlimited.

Control (protocol 0x00) has the following packet payloads:
	Code (1 byte) / Payload
	Codes can be:
		- CONNECTED (0x00); sent on WebSocket open or auth completion; the payload means:
			Auth method (1 byte) / Gateway Spoofing Allowed (1 byte) / Hostname length (1 byte) / Assigned hostname ([Hostname length] bytes)
			"Gateway Spoofing Allowed" is either 0 or 255.
			Auth methods:
				- NO_AUTH (0x00); no authentication is needed, sent after the auth is completed
				- PUBKEY_AUTH (0x01); authenticate using Ed25519 key
		- AUTH_FAILED (0x01); sent when public key or signature is incorrect
		- SIGN_REQUEST (0x02); sent after sending public key; the following payload is 32 bytes
		- PUBKEY_SEND (0x03); sending the public key; the payload is:
			Ed25519 public key coordinate (32 bytes) / User-customizable bits (4 bytes) / Hostname length (1 byte) / Requested hostname ([Hostname length] bytes)
		- SIGNATURE_SEND (0x04); sending the signature; the payload is 64 bytes of the Ed25519 signature
		- INVALID_SOURCE (0x05); sent when the source address is spoofed
		- ADDRESS_CONFLICT (0x06); sent when the address generated ends up the same as another one that is connected
		- ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE (0x07); sent when the target address is not registered in the network

Ping (protocol 0x01) has the following packet payloads:
	Is Pong (1 byte) / Payload (64 bytes)
	If "Is Pong" is 0, re-send the same packet with the source and target addresses swapped and "Is Pong" set to 255.

Connectionless (protocol 0x02) has the following packet payloads:
	Gate Size (1 byte) / Gate ([Gate Size] bytes) / Payload
	If the "Gate" starts with "user_", it is non-privileged. All other gates are privileged.
	Privileges are determined by the system connected to the network.

	On gate "resolve" connectionless-based protocol has the following connless payload:
		Reply Gate Size (1 byte) / Reply Gate ([Reply Gate Size] bytes) / Query Size (1 byte) / Query ([Query Size] bytes)
		A server, if running, should direct their reply at the specified "Reply Gate" with the following connless payload equaling 16 bytes of the address.
		If a server replies with 0 bytes, it means no reply is available. The domain might not be found.

Connectionful (protocol 0x03) has the following packet payloads:
	Is Server (1 byte) / Connection ID (16 bytes) / Action (1 byte) / Payload
	Is Server set to 255 is a server; to 0 is a client.
	Actions:
		- START (0x00); sent when connection begins. The payload means, for a message from the client to the server:
			Gate Size (1 byte) / Gate ([Gate Size] bytes) / Temporary key
			For a message from the server to the client, only the temporary key is the payload.
		- XCHANGE (0x01); sent when exchanging permanent keys
			Initialization Vector (12 bytes) / Ciphertext
		- DROP (0x02); sent on disconnection. Has no payload
		- DATA (0x03); sent when exchanging data (the most of the connection)
			Initialization Vector (12 bytes) / Ciphertext
		- NICE2MEETU (0x04); sent by client only when completing verification (after xchange)
